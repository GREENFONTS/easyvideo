# Youtube Word Search
This full stack project helps the everyday youtube user to be able to search for a particular sentence or word in a video instead of re-watching the whole video. With the help of youtube captions this has been made possible.

Leveraging the art of web scrapping using [Puppetter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) a Nodejs npm library , the timestamp of the searched word can be extracted and using a great frontend framework [React](https://reactjs.org/) is rendered and the timestamp used to seek to the point of the seeked word or sentence.

The caveat of using puppetter is due to it creates an instance of chromium at every run job requests which reduces processing speed, consumes memeory and leads to sometimes timeout during multiple requests. With the leevrageing of job-queueing, the timeout issue is resolved but still with little delay in processing. Although, it can run faster when used with high performance dynos or processors.
