# Youtube Word Search
This full stack project helps the everyday youtube user to be able to search for a particular sentence or word in a video instead of re-watching the whole video. With the help of youtube captions this has been made possible.

Leveraging the art of web scrapping using [Puppetter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) a Nodejs npm library , the timestamp of the searched word can be extracted and using a great frontend framework [React](https://reactjs.org/) is rendered and the timestamp used to seek to the point of the seeked word or sentence.

Thanks to [Samson Amugo] & Cryil Chukwuebuka for their assistance during the project development phase
